## Overview

Effective inventory management is critical for businesses of all sizes. The **Inventory Optimization System** provides accurate inventory forecasts and optimized reorder points to help businesses:

- Avoid stockouts that disrupt operations and sales.
- Minimize overstocking, reducing holding costs.
- Make data-driven decisions for procurement and inventory planning.

This project integrates predictive modeling and interactive dashboards to deliver actionable insights into inventory management.

---

## Features

- **Demand Forecasting:** Predict future inventory needs using historical sales data and seasonal trends.
- **Reorder Point Optimization:** Calculate reorder points for each item based on lead times, demand variability, and service levels.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualize inventory trends, forecast accuracy, and optimization outcomes using Power BI or Tableau.
- **Scalability:** Handle large datasets with multiple inventory items and complex patterns.
- **Customization:** Adapt models to specific business needs, including safety stock adjustments and multi-location inventory tracking.

---

## Tech Stack

### Programming Languages and Libraries

- **Python:** Core programming language.
  - `Statsmodels`: For time series analysis and forecasting.
  - `Scikit-learn`: For regression models and advanced analytics.
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy`: For data manipulation and analysis.

### Visualization Tools

- **Power BI** or **Tableau**: For interactive, user-friendly dashboards.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Power BI Desktop or Tableau installed on your system

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-optimization-system.git
   cd inventory-optimization-system
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Place historical inventory data in the `data/raw` folder as CSV files.
   - Ensure the data includes columns for `Item ID`, `Date`, `Sales Quantity`, and `Lead Time`.

5. **Run Data Preparation:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_preparation.py
   ```

6. **Generate Forecasts:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/forecasting.py
   ```

7. **View Dashboards:**
   - Use Power BI or Tableau to load visualization templates from the `dashboards/` folder.

## Usage

### Input Data Requirements

The system requires historical inventory data with the following columns:

- `Item ID`: Unique identifier for each inventory item.
- `Date`: Date of recorded sales or stock levels.
- `Sales Quantity`: Number of units sold on each date.
- `Lead Time`: Average lead time (in days) for reordering.

### Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Clean the raw data for inconsistencies and missing values.
   - Aggregate data at appropriate time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

2. **Forecasting:**
   - Use time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA) for items with seasonal patterns.
   - Apply regression models for items with irregular demand patterns.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Calculate reorder points using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model and safety stock considerations.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Load forecasts and optimization outputs into dashboards for analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Forecasting Models:**
   - **ARIMA/SARIMA:** For time series data with identifiable trends and seasonality.
   - **Machine Learning Models (Scikit-learn):** Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, or Linear Regression for non-linear patterns.

2. **Reorder Point Calculation:**
   - Formula: 
     ```
     Reorder Point = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
     ```
   - Safety Stock is determined using demand variability and desired service levels.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Forecast Accuracy (MAPE, RMSE)
   - Inventory Turnover Ratio
   - Stockout Rates
